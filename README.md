This repository contains a Tcl script with a bug related to incorrect handling of the base case in a recursive function. The bug is described in detail in the bug.tcl file.  The solution, which correctly handles the base case, is provided in bugSolution.tcl. This example highlights a common error in recursive function implementation, where failing to define the base case correctly leads to unexpected results or infinite recursion.
